<h1 style="color:green"><span style="color:green">Mat√© üßâ</span></h1>


Mat√© is a comprehensive framework for deep learning projects that aims to streamline the development process and make it easier for developers to create high-quality projects. It includes features such as a training manager to help you set up, run, and monitor your models, as well as a package manager to manage dependencies and share code with others.


Mat√© also includes a [MateHub](https://salamanderxing.github.io/mate/), a store of all available modules that can be easily accessed and incorporated into a project. With support for multiple deep learning frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Jax, Mat√© is flexible and can be used with the tools you already know and love.


Mat√© standardizes project structure to make it easy to understand and work with, while still allowing for flexibility and customization. And with its intuitive design, Mat√© is easy to learn and use, saving you time and effort in the development process. Make your deep learning projects more efficient and effective with Mat√©.
