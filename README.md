Mat√© is a comprehensive framework for deep learning projects that aims to streamline the development process and make it easier for developers to create high-quality projects. It includes features such as a training manager to help you set up, run, and monitor your models, as well as a package manager to manage dependencies and share code with others.


Mat√© also includes a [MateHub](https://salamanderxing.github.io/mate/), a store of all available modules that can be easily accessed and incorporated into a project. With support for multiple deep learning frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Jax, Mat√© is flexible and can be used with the tools you already know and love.


Mat√© standardizes project structure to make it easy to understand and work with, while still allowing for flexibility and customization. And with its intuitive design, Mat√© is easy to learn and use, saving you time and effort in the development process. Make your deep learning projects more efficient and effective with Mat√©.

- *[THINGSvision](https://github.com/ViCCo-Group/thingsvision)*





## For Coders
Dear coders, we try our best to not get in your way and in fact, you do not have to integrate or import any mate class to your projects. Mate simply parses the configuration. To make your project mate compatible, you need to move a few files and make a Bombilla configuration file. 


**More tutorials and examples will be added soon!!**



## FAQ
**Q: Does Mat√© work with colab?**

**A**: Yes! Mat√© works with colab as any Mat√© project is exportable to a juypter notebook.
