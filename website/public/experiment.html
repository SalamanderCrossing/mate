<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>
<p>
  Experiments are written in <strong>restricted python</strong>. Meaning it’s
  python but with some limitations that will keep your mate project tidy. The
  following statements are not supported in a Mate experiment:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>loops</li>
  <li>functions</li>
  <li>math operations</li>
  <li>
    only one if-elif statement is allowed. To check the command sent to the
    experiment (usually <code>train</code> or <code>test</code>).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<p>You should only import from the root of a module.</p>
For example, this is not a valid import:
<p align="center" style>
  <img
    src="./imgs/python_781fb6a012170781ee7755615a617313.svg"
    style="max-width: 550px"
    alt="Your Image"
  />
</p>
<p>And this is instead valid:</p>
<p align="center" style>
  <img
    src="./imgs/python_d80cc51c2ccb5bf9ede99aeb7ce63170.svg"
    style="max-width: 550px"
    alt="Your Image"
  />
</p>
<h3 id="why-these-rules">Why these rules?</h3>
<p>
  A mate experiment, although a subset of python, is just a configuration file
  where you should put all your hyperparameters. It’s meant to be where you
  import all your modules and organize them together to run your experiment.
  Defining loops and functions here would imply that you can skip organizing
  your project into modules and do everything in this file, thus losing all the
  attractive properties you get from modularity.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re tempted to write functions or loops, maybe you should create a new
  module.

<h3 id="mate-module-inside-your-experiment">
  Mate module inside your experiment
</h3>
<p>
  In your experiment, you usually want to import the <code>mate</code> module,
  like so:
</p>
<p align="center" style>
  <img
    src="./imgs/None_c9495276ed784543b08b104ee0fb2510.svg"
    style="max-width: 550px"
    alt="Your Image"
  />
</p>
<p>
  This module contains variables and functions that are useful to run your
  experiment. For example, the <code>mate.command</code> contains the command
  sent to the experiment (usually <code>train</code> or <code>test</code>). And
  <code>mate.result(...)</code> allows you to save results of your experiments.
  Check out <a href="./mate.md">its doc page</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="organizing-your-experiments">Organizing your experiments</h3>
<p>
  You should create a new experiment for each different configuration you want
  to run. For example, if you want to run an experiment with a different
  learning rate, you should create a new experiment. This will keep your
  experiments organized and easy to find.
</p>
<p>Below you can find an example of a valid mate experiment:</p>
<p align="center" style>
  <img
