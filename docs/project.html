<h1 id="mate-project">Mate Project</h1>
<p>
  The root of a mate project is where you can find the <code>mate.json</code>.
  Mate will generate this file for you when you do <code>mate init</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Mate leverages on modularity. This means that you should organize your project
  as a set of <em>independent</em> modules. Independent means that your modules
  cannot import each other. This is a good thing because it allows you to reuse
  your modules in other projects. For example, you can use the same data loader
  in a different project. This is also a good thing because it allows you to
  easily test your modules. You can test your data loader without having to test
  your model or your trainer.
</p>
<p>
  A python module can <em>export</em> objects (such as classes or functions) by
  adding them to the <code>__init__.py</code> file at the root of your module.
  Notice that you don’t have to do this manually, you can do
  <code>mate export model.my_model.file_name.ClassName</code> for example (see
  the <a href="./cli.md">CLI docs</a>)
</p>
<p>Each module can belong to one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>models</strong>: contains the models of your project. If, for
    example your working with pytorch, each model should be a subclass of
    <code>torch.nn.Module</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>data_loaders</strong>: contains the data loaders of your project.
    If, for example your working with pytorch, each data loader should be a
    subclass of <code>torch.utils.data.Dataset</code>. But mate doesn’t check
    this, so if you want you can also export functions or something else
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>trainers</strong>: modules in here should contain the training
    logic/loop.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>experiments</strong>: contains the experiments of your project. Each
    experiment is a python file in charge of running the experiments. See the
    <a href="./experiments.md">experiments docs</a> for more info.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-structure-of-a-mate-project">File structure of a mate project</h2>
<p>
  The file structure of a mate project is just a collection of nested python
  modules (a folder is a python module if it contains a
  <code>__init__.py</code> file, which may be empty). When you do a
  <code>mate init</code> you’ll automatically generate a simple mate folder
  structure.
</p>
<p>Typically, a file structure will look something like this:</p>
<p align="center" style>
  <img
    src="./imgs/None_b615eff207c7f42c2cc4f6d07ddfe126.svg"
    style="max-width: 550px"
    alt="Your Image"
  />
</p>
<p>And this is how the <code>mate summary</code> command displays it:</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0; padding: 0">
  <img src="./imgs/summary.svg" alt="Your Image" style="max-width: 500px" />
</p>
<p>To a mate project, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    all the <code>README.md</code> files are optional but, if present, will be
    used by the <code>mate show</code> command to display a module (with its
    submodules).
  </li>
  <li>In each python module, you may only have the following:</li>
  <li>an<code>__init__.py</code></li>
  <li>a readme</li>
  <li>
    other submodules No other files/folders are allowed. Inside the leaf
    modules, on the other hand (ex <code>models/ae</code>), everything is
    permitted except for the following rule.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each submodule inside a root module (ex <code>models/ae</code>) may not
    import from other submodules in the mate project, i.e., it has to be
    isolated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Different rules apply to the experiment’s files (ex
    <code>experiments/ae_cifar.py</code>). See the experiments section below.
  </li>
</ul>
